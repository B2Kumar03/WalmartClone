## Introduction

The WalmartClone project is a React-based front-end web application that emulates the core functionalities of an online shopping platform, specifically inspired by Walmart. The project focuses on providing users with a seamless shopping experience, allowing them to explore a variety of products, add items to their cart, proceed to checkout, and choose delivery options. Additionally, false account creation is implemented; without an account created, users are not able to checkout the product because user authentication is set to false. If you want to checkout a product, please create an account.

## Features

### 1. Product Browsing:
- Explore a wide range of products with detailed information and images.

### 2. Search Product by Product Category:
- Search for specific items based on categories like jewelry.

### 3. Add to Cart:
- Add the desired item(s) to your shopping cart.

### 4. View Shopping Cart:
- View all the items added to the shopping cart with total payment and taxes before making any purchase.

### 5. Checkout:
- Proceed to checkout where you can enter your shipping details, select delivery type, and review your order summary.
- Proceed to make a purchase after reviewing the contents of the shopping cart.

### 6. False Account Creation:
- A user can create a false account with an email, name, and phone number. All details of the user are stored in the local storage as a database.

### 7. User Login:
- Users can log in to the application using their registered credentials. If the user is not registered, they can create an account.
- During login, the application matches the user details from local storage with the stored user details.
